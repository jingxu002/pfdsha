algorithm of PFDSHA
  1st step:
read fault trace and seismicity, sequence in segment
  2ed step:
read site coordinate
  3rd step:
read coefficient of displacement equation
the parameter value are
depend on type of displacement, 
principal & distributed
  4th step:
loop on Mu, m, epsilon(SRL)
compute the annual probability of displacement exceedance given fault displacement.
