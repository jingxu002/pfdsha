\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
Fault displacement hazard problem is an essential part in the safety analysis for important infrastructures, like nuclear installation, oil pipeline, etc.\citep{Alexander:2011,Chapman:2014}.
\cite{stepp:2001} conducted the first-of-a-kind assessment of probabilistic fault dispalcement hazard on the potential geologic respository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.

\citet{youngs:2003} presented a methodology for couducting a site-specific probabilistic analysis of fault displacement hazard, developed a fault displacement prediction equation (FDPE) for the normal faulting environment. 
\citet{wesnousky:06,wesnousky:08} investigated the relationship between earthquake rupture trace and accompanied coseismic slip along the fault strike. 
\citet{petersen:11} presented a methodology and regression equations for calculating the fault rupture hazard at sites near steeply dipping, strike-slip faults.
\citet{takao:13} overviewed the probabilistic fault displacement hazard analysis (PFDHA) method proposed by Youngs in 2003, and applied the method in Japan, proposed the evaluation formula based on the surface earthquake faults generated by reverse and strike faults in Japan.

The FDPE is an region-sepcifc regression equation based on earthquake 
rupture data investigated after large earthquakes until now. 
Moderate earthqakes introduced significant surface rupture 
demonstrated the necessary of modifition of FDPE \citep{delong:15}. 

This manuscript describes the methodology of PFDHA, 
 presents an updated FDPE for strike-slip fault 
based on moderate and large earthqakes.
The updated FDPEs include two principal fault displacement models,
in the form of elliptic and quadratic, respectively.
In addition,
a case study of  Zemu River fault in western China, 
is presented to demonstrate the application of PFDHA 
to a specific fault displacement hazard problem of 
strike-slip fault under segmental Possion seismicity model.

\section{Methodology}
\label{method}
The methodology of PFDHA is directly taken from that of ground motion
probabilistic sesimic hazard analysis (PSHA), 
the frequency at which the displacement, $D$, on an engineering site near an active fault,
exceeds a specified amount, $d$, during a single earthquake event
can be expressed as \citep{youngs:2003}:

\begin{equation}
  f(D \geq d) = \sum_n \mu_n (m_0) \int_{m_0}^{m_u^n} f_n(m)
  [\int_0^{\infty} f_n(r|m) P^*(D \geq d | m, r)dr]dm
  \label{eq:1}
\end{equation}

where $\mu_n (m_0)$ is the annual rate of earthquakes on source $n$ 
above a minimum magnitudes of engineering significance, $m_0$;
$f_n (m)$ is the probability density function of earthquake 
size $m$ between $m_0$ and the maximum earthquake that source 
$n$ can produce, $m_u ^n$;
$f_n (r|m)$ is the conditonal probability density function for 
distance from engineering site to an earthquake of magnitude $m$
occurring on source $n$;
$P^*(D \geq d |m,r)$ is the probability for fault displacement at
or near the groud surface, $D$, exceeds the given value, $d$.

$P^*$ differs from the probability of exceedance for ground motion
parameters, it contains two terms, as follow:

\begin{equation}
	P^*(D \geq | d) = P(slip | m, r) P(D \geq d | m, r, slip)  
  \label{eq:2}
\end{equation}

The first term of \eqref{eq:2}, $P(slip | m, r)$, 
is the  conditional probability that some amount of displacement occurs
at engineering site as a result of an earthquake of magnitude $m$ with
rupture at distance of $r$ from the site.
To evaluate the fault displacement hazard of strike-slip fault in western China,
applied the empirical expression of $P(slip | m, r)$ developed by \citet{wells:1993}.
Their equation for calculating the probability of surface rupture is given by
a logistic regression model that provides the conditional probability of surface rupture:

\begin{equation}
  P(slip | m, r) = \frac{e^{a+bm}}{1+e^{a+bm}}
  \label{eq:3}
\end{equation}

where, constants a and b are -12.51 and 2.053, respectively.

The second term of \eqref{eq:2} definds the conditional distribution of
the amount of fault displacement, $D$, when the slip occurs.
This probability is computed using a continuous distribution with parameters
that are functions of $m$ and perhaps $r$, 
unlike the standard ground motion predict equation (GMPE), 
the displacement may depend on the relative location of
the site along the length of the fault rupture.

\section{Fault displacement prediction equation (FDPE)}
\label{fdpe}
In this program (PFDHA), the  displacement on strike-slip fault, $D$, 
is normalized by the mean displacement $MD$, 
follows lognormal distribution;
the FDPE is a function of location of engineering site along the rupture, 
denoted by the ratio $l/L$, where $l$ is the distance from one end of 
the rupture to engineering site and $L$ is the length of surface rupture,
could give the mean and standard deviation
of the logarithm of normalized fault displacement, $D/MD$.

To calculate the mean fault displacement, $MD$, 
which is need to normalize $D$, adopted the equation for
strike-slip faults developed by \citet{wells:1994}.
The formula as follows:

\begin{equation}
  \log_{10}(MD) = a + bm \pm \varepsilon
  \label{eq:4}
\end{equation}

where $MD$ in meters, $a$ is -6.32, $b$ is 0.90, 
and $\varepsilon$, the standard deviation in $\log_{10}$ units, is 0.28.

%% data, regression, figure, table


%% existed regression
\citet{petersen:11} developed least-squares, best-fit regression equations
for the natural logarithm of normalized on-fault displacement 
$D/MD$ that consider engineering site location along 
fault surface rupture, for several functional forms.
The measured displacements in several places after the 2014 Napa Mw 6.0 eathquake,
fall clearly out the predicted uncertainty range, 
with dramatically higher values \citep{baize:2016}.
So it is necessary to re-evaluate the FDPE developed by \citet{petersen:11},
especially caused by  middle-strong eathquakes.
Large earthquakes occured in western China would produce surface rupture,
field investigation following the 2010 Ms 7.1 Yushu earthquake and 
2014 Ms 7.3 Yutian earthquake, 
illustrated the displacement  along surface rupture zone,
showed the surface rupture were characterized by 
strike-slip motion with normal component \citep{pjw:2011, lhb:2015}.

Based on principal  displacement data of strike-slip fault compiled by 
\citet{wesonusky:08} and \citet{petersen:11}, supplemented 
the displacement data of 2010 Ms 7.1 Yushu, 2014 Ms 7.3 Yutian, 
2014 Mw 6.0 West Napa earthquakes, 
developed the predict equation of the logarithm of 
normalized principal displacement, $\log (D/MD)$,
into a portion of a parabolic and an elliptic shape. 








%% figure
Figure \ref{fig:fit_quad} is a scatter chart showing 
the distribution of the raw displacement data and 
the regression model and the predicted uncertainties for the parabolic case.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{fit_quad.eps}
  \caption{Normalized principal-fault displacement data with parabolic 
  	   regression line and uncertainties 
	   ($\pm 1, \pm 2$, and $\pm 3$ standard deviations)}
  \label{fig:fit_quad}
\end{figure}

%% equation parabolic
The parabolic model of FDPE is given by

\begin{equation}
  \log(D/MD) = -21.85(l/L)^2 + 15.79(l/L)^2 - 3.06
  \label{eq:parabolic}
\end{equation}

This regression yielded a standard deviation of 1.005 
in natural logarithm.



Figure \ref{fig:fit_elli} is a scatter chart showing 
the distribution of the raw displacement data and 
the regression model for the elliptic case.

\begin{figure}[htbp] 
  \centering
   \includegraphics{fit_elli.eps}

  	   regression model  and uncertainties 
	   ($\pm 1, \pm 2$, and $\pm 3$ standard deviations)}
  \label{fig:fit_elli}
\end{figure}

Through a transformation, obtain the elliptic model of FDPE,

\begin{align}
 &  \log (D/MD) = 3.624 x - 3.768  \\ 
 &  x = \sqrt {1 - 0.25[(l/L) - 0.5]^2} \notag
  \label{eq:ellipic}
\end{align}

This regression yielded a standard deviation of 1.009 
in natural logarithm.

\section{Case study: Zemu River fault }
\label{zmh}
In this section, present examples showing how to analyze
the fault rupture hazard on fault surface trace by the PFDHA program.
%% fault trace, seismicity model, fault displacement hazard curves

% fault trace
Zemu River fault zone is a left-lateral strike-slip fault zone,
the whole length of the fault zone is about 130km, 
strike nearly the direction of NW-SE, 
composed by   5  shear active sub-faults which 
arranged in left step en echelon \citep{wxz:1983, dps:2000}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./example/zmh_multi.eps}
  \caption{The surface trace of Zemu River fault}
  \label{fig:zemu_river}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Seismicity Model}
In order to present the non-uniform characteristic of 
the distribution of intraplate earthquakes in China,
the engineering-seismologists adopted segmental Poisson model
% to replace the Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-frequency distribution,
for compiling the seismic hazard  map of China.
The modified seismicity model (CPSHA) consists of the seismic province,
the background seismicity zone, 
and the tectonic features zone \citep{ph:2013}.
Specific to the Zemu River fault zone, it is located in 
Xichang seismic source zone, belongs to Xianshui River-Diandong 
seismic province.

Firstly the estimated seismicity parameters of seismic province,
include the maximum magnitude, $M_{max}$, 
annual rate of earthquakes lager than 
or equal to the minimum magnitude (Ms 4.0) need to be considered, $\mu_4$,
and the $b$ value in Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-frequency distribution,
are Ms 8.0, 32, 0.85, respectively.
The earthquakes in seismic province are categorized into 7 magnitude bins (MB), 
and then allocated to seismic source zones by spatial distribution function (SDF).
At last is to distribute the seismicity of Xichang seismic source zone to Zemu River fault zone by partiton factor (PF),
the maximum background earthquake of Xianshui River-Diandong seismic province is Ms 6.0,
so in the magnitude bins smaller than 6.0, 
take the ratio of area of Zemu River fault zone to Xichang seismic source zone as partition factor;
when the magnitude increased, the earthquake epicenters distributed along the Zemu River fault zone,
than the partition factor also increased.
The earthquake bins of Xianshui River-Diandong seismic province, 
spatial distribution functon of Xichang seismic source zone,
and partition factor of Zemu River fault zone, are reported in table \ref{tab:sdf}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
	\caption{The magnitude bins of Xianshui River-Diandong seismic province,
             spatial distribution functon of Xichang seismic source zone,
             and partition factor of Zemu River fault zone.  }

	\begin{tabular}{llllllll}
		\\
		\hline
	MB & 4-4.9 & 5-5.4 & 5.5-5.9 & 6-6.4 & 6.5-6.9 &  7-7.4 &  $\geq$ 7.5                \\

	SDF & 0.0086 & 0.0063 & 0.0087 & 0.006 & 0.0126 & 0.036 & 0.1136 \\
