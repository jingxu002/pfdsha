PFDSHA  zemuhe
==============
probabilistic fault displacement seismic hazard analysis, code in Matlab.
Example to compute primary displacement on Zemuhe fault,
seismicity parameters derived from the 5th generation of national seismic ground motion map for China.



Function used to read input
---------------


rdfault: 
~~~~~~~~
read fault trace and seismicity of every segments, the structure of input file is as follows:

number of faults
number of segments of current fault
number of points in segment **jj** on fault **ii**
coordinate points on fault trace (longitude, latitude)

nmi, number of magnitude interval
mag, start value (and the end value of last interval)  of magnitude interval
sf, spatial distribution function
frac, fraction of earthquake number in magnitude interval

rdsc
~~~~~~~
read site location need to compute fault displacement
longitude, latitude


rdques
~~~~~~
read question, the context in file is as follow:
number of given fault displacement,
given fault displacement,
number of given annual probatility of fault displacement
given annual probability of fault displacement
