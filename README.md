PFDSHA  zemuhe
==============
probabilistic fault displacement seismic hazard analysis, code in Matlab.
Example to compute primary displacement on Zemuhe fault,
seismicity parameters derived from the 5th generation of national seismic ground motion map for China.



Function used to read input
---------------


rdfault: 
read fault trace and seismicity of every segments, the structure of input file is as follows:

number of faults

number of segments of current fault

number of points in segment **jj** on fault **ii**

coordinate points on fault trace (longitude, latitude)
